# sale\_template\_quotation


Allow quotations to be frozen for use as templates.

A new button is added to the Quotation screen, "Convert to Template", which
freezes the quotation preventing it from being edited or converted to a sales
order.

A new Quotation Reference field is also created which must be filled in
before conversion to a template.
